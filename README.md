## Restaurant Orders Challenge

This is a randomly generated coding challenge for basic programming in Java. I am merely adding to it for fun and practice. 

Here is the original assignment:

"Challenge: Restaurant Order Management System

Create a simple console-based application in Java to manage orders in a restaurant. The application should allow a user to add orders, view all orders, and mark an order as completed.

Requirements:

Order Class:

Create an Order class with at least the following attributes: orderId, orderDetails (a String describing the order), and isCompleted (a boolean indicating if the order is completed).
Include methods for setting and getting these attributes.
Order Management System:

Implement a main class with methods to add an order, view all orders, and mark an order as completed.
Use a collection (like an ArrayList) to store the list of orders.
User Interaction:

In the main method, provide a menu to the user with options to add an order, view all orders, mark an order as completed, and exit the application.
Use the Scanner class to read user input.
Functionalities:

Adding an Order: Prompt the user for order details and add the order to the collection.
Viewing All Orders: Display all orders with their details and completion status.
Marking an Order as Completed: Allow the user to input an order ID and mark the corresponding order as completed.
Error Handling:

Include basic error handling for user inputs (like entering an invalid option or order ID).
Bonus:

Implement data persistence by saving and loading the orders to and from a file.
Add functionality to edit or delete orders.
This challenge covers basic Java concepts such as classes, collections, user input handling, and conditional logic. It's a great way to practice object-oriented programming and get a feel for a simple application's workflow."
